# ethics-in-shopping
Chrome plugin to inform ethical shopping decisions

Now replaced by https://github.com/amy-phillips/EthicalShopping - a rewrite that parses the information straight off ethical consumer website, so much lower maintenance!





Old description:

This extension sets the background colour of items on the Sainsbury's or Tesco website.  
Items containing unethical palm oil get a red background.  
Items not containing palm oil, or those containing ethically sourced palm oil get a green background.
I've used data from http://www.ethicalconsumer.org/shoppingethically/palmoilfreelist.aspx - I'm hoping to expand the extension to work on other websites, and to give ethical information on a wider range of shopping.
